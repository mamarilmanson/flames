		<b>F.L.A.M.E.S.</b> is a favorite past time in the Philippines which means Friends, Lovers, Anger, Married, Engaged and Sweethearts. It starts with writing two names in a piece of paper, your name and the name of the one whom you admire - may be a crush - then the rule is to count all the similar letters within your name, then get the total, after that count from 1 until you reach the total number of similar letters where <b>F</b> is 1, <b>L</b> is 2 and so on. <br/><br/>View this example: </span>
